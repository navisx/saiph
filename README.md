## Notes

Self botting can result in your account getting banned! If the program sends too many requests in a short time interval, it is very likely you could be banned! Use this program only if you understand the risks involved!

The program reads through all messages, looking for any and all discord invites, once one is found, it will automatically attempt to join the server through discord's APIs.

It uses your token to post messages as you. It reacts to you and you only. A token is a small piece of encrypted text. It basically is the key all Discord applications will need to connect to the account the app should run on."
